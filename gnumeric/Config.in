		notice: may or may not break your entire buildsystem
		results are unpredictable and annoying
		
		i got it to build in a screen session, while also
		outputting logs to a file via
		"make 2>&1 | tee file.txt", so try that if in doubt
		
		BROKEN, SORT OF: doesnt appear to install in testing
		compiles, but binary is not copied to target
		investigation will be required at some point
