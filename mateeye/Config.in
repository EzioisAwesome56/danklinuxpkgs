		Eye of MATE is an image viewer for the MATE desktop
		of which it is a fork of eye of GNOME, from the GNOME 2 days
		
		I wouldve gone with the actual gnome 2 version, but based
		on my experiences with file-roller, it is easier to ship
		slightly older but still newer versions from MATE
		
		from the MATE Desktop
